# TESLA Workflow

A bash script based workflow for training a machine learning potential automatically.

## Introduction

**T**rain-**E**xplore-**S**cree-**L**abel **A**ctive (TESLA) learning workflow is a workflow for training a machine learning potential automatically. This workflow is inspired by [dpgen](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) and [ai2-kit](https://github.com/chenggroup/ai2-kit). 

This workflow is built with `oh-my-batch` and `ai2-kit`. It's purely based on bash scripts so that it's easy to understand and modify.

## Getting Started

To run the workflow, you need to ensure your environment has Python 3. And then all you need to do is to run the following command:

```bash
./run.sh
```
